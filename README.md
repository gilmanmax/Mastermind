Mastermind Game

The goal of this game is to guess a series of four digits, each digit being 1 through 6. When making your guess, please enter your input in the following form: ####
You have 10 guesses to guess the correct digit. 

After making a guess a combination of + and - (or nothing) will return. Each + means one digit in the right place, and each - means one correct digit but in the wrong place. 
Duplicate digits will count as incorrect digits.

Example: The correct code is 2325.

A guess of 2522 will return ++-. There are two 2s in the right place, and a five in the wrong place. The final two is an extra duplicate and is an incorrect digit.
A guess of 1111 will return an empty string, as there are no correct digits.
